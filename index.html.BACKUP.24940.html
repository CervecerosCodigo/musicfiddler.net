        <article id="introduction">
            <h3>Identifying the project </h3>

            <p>Utility can be a goal in it self. Groundbreaking new ideas that will save the world is not always that easy,
            and most of the successful websites in the world are not groundbreaking, at least not initially.
            Usually one want to provide utility for the target group, and in doing so developing the product into something that no one thought they needed
            until suddenly no one could get by without it.</p>

            <p>The process of finding a realizable product for a school project has lots of constraints, time being the most limiting.
            A front end web project doesn't really end, where you can say "We are now finished and there is nothing else to fix or do."
            This has been quite important in our search for a good project. Having a clear scope for what we want to make,
            and keep it simple and good looking.</p>

            <p>As students, and being young during the golden era of Internet we are flooded by online services.
            Many of the successful services and websites are the ones that are extensible by 3rd party developers.
            By not opening and API towards the general public you will not be able to attract interest from other influential parties
            in the "websphere". This can be bloggers, social media and more traditional media in general.</p>

            <h4>Learning goals</h4>
            <p>Being very technology minded and having programing and technical solutions as the goal of future careers,
            we have been clear on the following learning goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Focus on technical aspects.</li>
                <li>- Use Javascript to make a dynamic, user friendly website.</li>
                <li>- Reusable CSS rules and good structure on HTMl and Javascript coding.</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Narrowing down possibilities</h4>
            <p>Our take on the project was not to make the content ourselves but use some of the existing sources on the web,
            and make a website that provides more utility for the target group. This has several benefits that will be described
            further down in the documentation</p>

            <p>Using existing data from other web services is still a very broad domain, and in our team discussions we
            discussed probably two dozen services. Our primary objective was finding enough relevant data that would make a rich
            website. This means we were looking for text, images and other relevant information that are related to the primary content.</p>

            <p>We believe that there will always be room for new types of information. Information that by itself makes sense
            and us useful, can be even more useful gathered in one place. </p>

            <h4>Target group</h4>
            <p>Trying to get the whole world interested in curling (the sport) with a good web site is not possible,
                and this has been important in our discussions, leading up to our final solution.
                Music sounded like a topic that almost all people can relate to, and having a broad target group, without
                trying too hard is a good thing, and it also has lots of existing sources on the web that we could use.</p>

        <article id="solution">
            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <p>MusicFiddler is a website that uses data from the following webservices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia: </a>Extensive articles about artists</li>
                <li>- <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm: </a>Lists of top artists, albums and artist news</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The website is trying to engage the user by being very minimalistic, and at the same time invite the user to click
            on the tiles that are presented. It's not immediately clear what should happen when you click it, and just a picture
            representing each artist is not revealing too much. We hope that this is will intrigue for other people also.</p>

            <p></p>

            <h4>Scope of work</h4>
            <p>The limited time we are given makes the amount of functionality we can implement also less.
            We came to a point when we could not implement any more functionality and still maintain a certain level
            of good design and coherence.</p>

            <p>We have left out several key parts of our original plans as a result of the time constraint.
            For instance we did not have time to implement Album information.</p>

            <p>Last.fm does have a vast array of relevant data. Suggestions for similar artists to the one you're
            looking at, was one of the features we did implement, but dropped on recommendation from Anthony.</p>


            <h4>Technology and architecture</h4>
            <p>Javascript is used extensively throughout the solution. There is Ajax functions getting data from the
            providers. They are running in Synchronous mode and not Async.. It was too complex to render the HTML
            before knowing whoch data that arrives through the API.</p>

            <p>Being denied Jquery and other useful tools has been a blessing as knowledge of vanilla Javascrip has been
            very valuable. Still, the functions are all freestanding, with out any controlling mechanism to provide
            updates in the view/html</p>


            <h4>What does the solution offer?</h4>
            <p>Individually the two API's that are used are great examples of online services that is free for anyone to use.
            Still we found that combining them together would be beneficial, and the result is unlike what they can provide
            by them selves.</p>
